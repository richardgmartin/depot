This Rails app is based on the 'depot' app in the book Agile Web Development with Rails 4 by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinmeier Hansson.

I have implemented the majority of the features and functions provided in the Agile cookbook. I skipped a few, namely the G2: Atom Feeds, Task H: Sending Mail, Task J: Internationalization, and Task K: Deployment and Production.

I customized some of the CSS to fit more my style. I also decided to deploy using Heroku and leveraged Capistrano.
